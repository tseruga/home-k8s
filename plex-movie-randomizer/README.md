## API Implementation

This app uses a two-step process for comprehensive movie data:

### **Step 1: Watchlist Data (plex.tv)**
- **Endpoint**: `https://metadata.provider.plex.tv/library/sections/watchlist/all`
- **Data**: Basic movie information (title, year, summary, rating, duration, posters)
- **Authentication**: Plex authentication token
- **Required**: Yes (core functionality)

### **Step 2: Detailed Metadata (Local Server)**
- **Endpoint**: `{baseUrl}/library/metadata/{ratingKey}` per [plexapi.dev](https://plexapi.dev/api-reference/library/get-media-metadata)
- **Data**: Genre information, detailed metadata
- **Authentication**: Plex server URL + token
- **Required**: No (optional for genre filtering)

The app connects to:
- **plex.tv**: For watchlist data and basic movie metadata (required)
- **Your local Plex server**: For detailed metadata including genres (optional)

No backend server is required - everything runs client-side in your browser.

## Configuration Options

- **Plex Token** (Required): Your authentication token from plex.tv
- **Plex Server URL** (Optional): Your local Plex server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:32400`)
  - Required for genre filtering functionality
  - Improves poster loading performance when available
  - If not provided, basic filtering by duration and rating still works

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid Plex token"**: Verify your Plex token is valid and not expired
- **"No movies found"**: Make sure you have movies in your Plex watchlist at plex.tv
- **"Failed to fetch watchlist from plex.tv"**: Check your internet connection and token validity
- **Genre filtering not available**: Configure your Plex server URL and click "Load Genres"
- **Images not loading**: 
  - Try configuring your local Plex server URL for better poster loading
  - Some movies may not have poster images available
- **Slow genre loading**: Genre information requires individual API calls per movie, which can take time for large watchlists

## Technical Details

- Built with SvelteKit and TypeScript
- **Two-step data loading**:
  1. Fast watchlist loading from plex.tv
  2. Optional detailed metadata fetching from local server
- Implements proper pagination for large watchlists
- Batched processing for genre loading (5 movies at a time)
- Comprehensive error handling and progress indicators
- Works offline for basic functionality (watchlist only)
